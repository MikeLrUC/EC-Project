The tools module contains various genetic algorithm components, used for the genetic algorithms
The utils module has utilitary code, for logging, plotting and statistics of the genetic algorithms.
In order to repeat the experiments in the report, one must run the parameters.py script, for parameters testing. 
For the effective comparison run, the genetic_algorithm.py script can be executed.
